    message: "ENHANCED PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS TESTING COMPLETED - ALL FUNCTIONALITY WORKING PERFECTLY: Comprehensive testing of the enhanced Product Specifications functionality with material layers and thickness calculation shows 100% success rate (7/7 tests passed). ✅ THICKNESS CALCULATION LOGIC FIXED: Backend now correctly calculates thickness by multiplying each layer's thickness by its quantity - verified with test case (2.5 * 1.0) + (1.8 * 2.0) + (0.7 * 1.0) = 6.8mm calculated correctly. ✅ ENHANCED MODELS VERIFIED: MaterialLayerAssignment model and enhanced ProductSpecification model working correctly with material_layers field, calculated_total_thickness, thickness_options, and selected_thickness fields. ✅ CRUD OPERATIONS: POST /api/product-specifications creates specifications with automatic thickness calculation, PUT /api/product-specifications updates with thickness recalculation, GET /api/product-specifications retrieves all enhanced fields. ✅ THICKNESS OPTIONS GENERATION: Properly generates ±5%, ±10%, and exact thickness options from calculated values (e.g., 6.12mm, 6.46mm, 6.8mm, 7.14mm, 7.48mm). ✅ GSM FIELD HANDLING: GSM field properly stored and retrieved in specifications dict. ✅ SELECTED THICKNESS: User-selected thickness from options properly saved and retrieved. ✅ REALISTIC THICKNESS VALUES: Successfully handles realistic thickness values in 0.15-3.2mm range with proper calculations. ✅ MATERIAL INTEGRATION: Materials successfully integrated with product specifications using both materials and products in material layers. All requested features from the review are fully functional and ready for production use. Authentication successful with Callum/Peach7510 credentials."
