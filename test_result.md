CRITICAL FINDINGS: The calculation logic appears correct in code, suggesting the issue may be in data flow, state management, or product data retrieval.

FINDINGS: 1) UI calculations are actually working perfectly (all quantity tests 1,2,3,5,10 passed with correct totals), 2) Unit price auto-population working correctly ($45.00), 3) The real issue is a 422 validation error from backend API. ERROR DETAILS: Backend expects 'product_id' field in OrderItem model (models.py line 165) but frontend only sends 'product_name'. API call shows: POST /api/orders returns 422 with validation error 'body → items → 0 → product_id: Field required'. CLIENT CATALOG STRUCTURE: Products have IDs (e.g., 'c7c3a234-8001-40e8-a1fd-c39cb1a829ff') but frontend product selection logic (OrderForm.js lines 479-502) only captures product_name, not product_id. SOLUTION REQUIRED: Update frontend to include product_id when creating order items. The React error 'Objects are not valid as a React child' likely occurs when trying to render the validation error response object."
